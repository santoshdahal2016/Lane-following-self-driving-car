algorithm for finding lanes:
1. Get image
2. Store a copy of original image
3. Convert image to grayscale
4. Reduce noise with gaussian blur
5. Apply canny to get the sharp edges (canny works using differentiation of successive image pixels)
6. Find region of interest in the image in terms of a mask
7. AND the mask image with canny image to get only the lane portion
8. Apply HoughLineP with some filters to the resulting image to get the lines present in the image
9. Iterate through the lines to find the slope and y-intercept of each line'
10. Create two array of slope and y-intercept and insert the respective iteraed values based
    on whether the slope is positive or negative to separate left and right lanes
11. Calculate the average of the two arrays to get the avergae slope and y-intercept of
    left and right side of the lane
12. Make two lines for the lane using the average slope and y-intercept and using y1 as inage height and y2 as some value times y1
13. View the lines in the image
